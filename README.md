DS_Store Mapper is a Python-based reconnaissance tool designed to recursively scan web servers for exposed .DS_Store files. These files, often unintentionally left behind on macOS-based deployments, can leak sensitive information about the directory structure, including hidden or deleted files.

By parsing .DS_Store files discovered on a web server, the tool can reconstruct directory listings, discover hidden or unlinked files, and recursively expand its scan to subdirectoriesâ€”allowing ethical hackers and security researchers to map the internal structure of a target web server.
